# flarnpond

flarnpond is a fork of todepond.

## quick start

If you are using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2), running updated Ubuntu vanilla, and also if you have firefox downloaded and installed on your Linux distribution, then you should be able to use the `firefox index.html` command while in the `Cell-Pond-main` directory.
If you are in the root directory, you can just use this double command:

```bash
cd CellPond-main
firefox index.thml
```

This will open CellPond in firefox.

## set up

you will need to do some stuff to get this set up

1. fork `flarnpond` or `TodePond`
2. download and run the source code: `https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
3. make changes to the fork
4. compare your version to the original

### fork the code

in order to get set up, you will need to fork either `flarnpond` or the original repository `TodePond`

to fork flarnpond -> https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnpond

to fork TodePond -> https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond

for either of these, if you are not familiar, you'll want to navigate to the location of the repository (each of those two links) and then click on the "Fork" icon near the top right corner of the screen.

The icon looks like this:

### download and run the source code

the source code is located here: `https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`. that's cool and all, but you may have no idea what to do next. Maybe you are a WSL2 person and just learning. If you are that person, then you've come to the right place.

The way we use this link to the source code is all in the file URL and how to work with the file extension. First, in order to make sure I do this correctly, I'm going to go and ask ChatGPT for help.

## how it works

when you left click on a color, the active color you will draw with changes.
when you click and drag the white squre out into the open, you can create colors.
i think the arrow is like the `=` in most programming languages, but im not sure.
